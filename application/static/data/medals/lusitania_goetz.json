    "In August 1915, German artist Karl Goetz cast a commemorative medal depicting the May 7, 1915 sinking of the Lusitania.",
    "It was the May 5 date on the medal that verified to the British that the Germans pre-meditated the sinking, a cowardly act.",
    "In fact, artist Goetz simply got the date wrong from using an erroneous newspaper report.",
    "About 430 medals of the first version with the May 5 date were minted in Goetz's home. He soon corrected the date to May 7.",
    "</p>",
    "<p>",
    "The British quickly utilized the first German version as propaganda.",
    "British Naval Intelligence ordered about 250,000 copies struck with the May 5 date and sold them through the Lusitania Souvenir Medal Committee to the public at one shilling each.",
    "The British-produced medal was presented in an attractive box with an explanatory certificate.",
    "The British-produced medals were made of iron and a darker color than the German originals.",
